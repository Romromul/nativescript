# Welcome to NativeScript 

## What is NativeScript

With NativeScript you can use your JavaScript and CSS skills to write native mobile applications for [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/), [Android](https://www.android.com/) and (very soon) [WindowsPhone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us). There is no *WebView* involved in rendering the app, as the UI is rendered by the native platform's rendering engine. Because of that the, app's entire UX **is** native.

NativeScript enables you to use a complete stack of cross-platform APIs to write the application code or, if you need, you can directly access all platform-specific native APIs using JavaScript only. That’s right - you can access all native APIs, not only the ones we thought would be useful!

We did not want to create just yet another ecosystem around a native cross-platform framework. We wanted to integrate and play well with all existing JavaScript and native iOS/Android/Windows ecosystems. That is why we also support using existing JavaScript libraries, as well as existing native Objective-C, Java and .NET libraries. We want to stress out that you **don't need to know Objective-C, Java or .NET* in order to reuse these libraries - their entire APIs will be available in JavaScript with no changes.
  
Because of the features listed above you get some important functionality right out of the box. The first is that NativeScript applications support the same accessibility models as native apps. This is important for anyone creating apps that need to meet certain accessibility standards before going live. This is also very useful when you start implementing functional or unit tests for your app. Several existing cross-platform tools like [Appium](www.appium.io) already work directly with NativeScript and provide accessibility automation.
  
The second major feature you get out of the box is 0-day support for new native platforms. Because NativeScript exposes the unmodified native APIs and UI, you can use the latest native APIs and new UI components when Apple, Google or Microsoft updated their mobile platforms.
  
 So let’s summarize what NativeScript enables you as of today: 
 - Build 100% native cross-platform apps, with a declarative UI, and the ability to implement platform-specific UIs
 - Share 100% of your code or use platform-specific APIs, depending on the app you’re building.
 - Code in standards-based ECMAScript 5 JavaScript. ES6 support is coming soon.
 - Use standards-based CSS syntax for styling
 - Use rich data binding and existing UI patterns to easily build complex user interfaces.
 - Reuse any native library available in Objective-C, Java or .NET (for example our native UI components - Telerik UI for iOS, Telerik UI for Android and Telerik UI for WindowsPhone)
 - Reuse any JavaScript library that is not browser-dependent
 - Reuse the QA tools for accessibility automation to write tests
 - Use the latest native platform features to create an amazing native user experience
 - Code in any IDE of your choice to implement your applications’ code using the NativeScript CLI
 - Use the Telerik Platform, AppBuilder and the full Visual Studio integration to get a rich development experience. Paid support is also available
   
We hope this gives you a good idea about what you can expect from NativeScript.
